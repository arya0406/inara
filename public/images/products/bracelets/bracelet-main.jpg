This is a binary file, I need you to copy an image file from your computer. Please run the following command in your terminal to create a placeholder for now:

Copy-Item -Path "d:\the_inara_studio\public\images\products\bracelet-1.jpg" -Destination "d:\the_inara_studio\public\images\products\bracelets\bracelet-main.jpg" -Force
